I am a Data Scientist based in Oslo, Norway, working at Chronos AS. 

I received my [Ph.D. in Cosmology](https://www.mn.uio.no/astro/english/research/news-and-events/events/disputations/2023/Daniel%20Christopher%20Herman) from the University of Oslo in 2023, with a focus on dust emission in our Galaxy and the Solar System and how they affect measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background. 

Since my Ph.D. my main areas of work have been in the machine learning realm. I have gained a broad set of expertise in networking, natural language processing and computer vision.
